I'm a second year Phd candidate from [College of Computer Science/Software](https://ccs.imu.edu.cn/), [Inner Mongolia University](https://www.imu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Passive WiFi Sensing, Federated Learning, Domain generalization, Multimodality, Self-supervised Learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Baoqi Huang](https://ccs.imu.edu.cn/info/1152/2841.htm).
